Geer Intern Assignment – Frontend (React Version)

✅ Task 1 – Product Listing Page
This project is a Product Listing Page built in React, inspired by Geer.in. It demonstrates my understanding of frontend development, responsive UI, and component-based architecture.

How to Run the Project

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/geer-intern-assignment.git
cd geer-intern-assignment/frontend

2. Install Dependencies

npm install

3. Start the Development Server

npm start

4. Visit the app at http://localhost:3000/products

🛠 Tech Stack Used -

React – JavaScript library for building user interfaces
React Router DOM – For routing between pages
Tailwind CSS – For utility-first responsive styling
Redux – For global state management
React Redux – To connect React components to the Redux store
Redux Toolkit – For writing clean Redux logic
Swiper.js – For responsive carousels/sliders
React Icons / Remix Icons – For icon usage
React Toastify – For showing toast notifications
Axios / Fetch API – For data fetching (if used)
Responsive Design – Fully responsive layout using Flexbox/Grid

📌 Notes / Assumptions
This submission includes only Task 1 (Frontend) using React instead of Next.js.

Product data is currently mocked locally in a .js or .json file for demonstration purposes.

The UI is designed to be responsive for mobile and desktop views.

Once Task 2 (Backend API) is implemented, the product list will fetch data dynamically from the API.

Optional features like search filter or individual product page can be implemented as enhancements.
